=softprop=

A poorly named script to match a dumbly named repo for some level of config
syncrhonization. Check this out anywhere and run the softprop.sh script, and as
long as all the arbitrary assumptions about your filesystem structure are
correct, you'll get configs hooked in for free -- no seriously, there's no cost!
Adding more should be straightforward. bashrc concatenates instead of replaces.
Might make others do that too, but not for now.
